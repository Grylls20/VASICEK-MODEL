# Vasicek Model: Interest Rate Modelling

This project implements the Vasicek Model for interest rate modelling, a popular quantitative finance technique for modeling the evolution of interest rates over time. The repository includes Python code, sample data, and visualizations to help you understand and apply the Vasicek Model to real-world interest rate data.

## Features
- Vasicek Model implementation in Python (`VasicekModel.py`)
- Sample datasets for central and state government securities
- Visualizations of model results (`Figure_1.png`, `Figure_2.png`)
- Example usage and instructions

## File Descriptions
- `VasicekModel.py`: Main Python script implementing the Vasicek Model.
- `Interest Rates on Central and State Government Dated securities.csv`: Sample interest rate data in CSV format.
- `Interest Rates on Central and State Government Dated securities.xlsx`: Same data in Excel format.
- `Figure_1.png`, `Figure_2.png`: Visualizations generated from the model and data.

## Example Usage
- Modify `VasicekModel.py` to use your own data or adjust model parameters.
- Use the provided CSV/Excel files for sample analysis.
- Generated figures will be saved as PNG files in the project directory.

## Acknowledgments
- The Vasicek Model was introduced by Oldřich Vašíček in 1977.
- Data sources: Central and State Government Securities.
